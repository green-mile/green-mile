Context
Sustainable living tries to reduce carbon emissions and embrace sustainability by recycling more and taking public transport. The key pillars are the Circular Economy, Eco Stewardship Programme and Green Commutes. 
We will reduce carbon emissions and embrace sustainability by consuming less, recycling more, and taking public transport. We will also work towards our vision of becoming a Zero Waste Nation powered by a circular economy, with “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle” as a norm for citizens and businesses.

Sustainable consumption is part of sustainable living as it aims to reduce food wastage through reusing and reducing. Currently, the Singapore Government aims to do this by batling food wastage.

Food wastage is greatly increasing due to the population and generally causes wasted water to be used for potentially wasted food and causes a larger carbon footprint. This contributes to climate change and global warming which is what sustainable living is trying to combat. 

If we reduce food wastage, there would be less demand for food as well which would have fewer resources wasted on food overall.

Currently, there are some adaptation solutions that are being implemented right now such as incineration of food waste. However, as the Government has stated, building waste disposal facilities is not an optimal solution for Singapore or a sustainable solution as Singapore has high land scarcity. Due to this, the government has tried to push non-digital mitigation solutions such as guidebooks (Education).

With this situation in mind, we have come up with a digital solution that tries to mitigate food wastage and would support the governments aim to reduce food wastage.


Problems faced regarding these topics (Food wastage)
-Businesses might not be accurately keeping their inventory in check and their expiry times. This leads to potentially thrown-away food. Businesses also waste costs. 
-Families can also have trouble keeping track of food expiry times this also leads to wasted food and wasted money and is especially critical for lower SES families
-Families don't have a centralised easy way to keep track of what is in their inventory as well
-Some families don’t care about it as they are not aware that wasting food causes a huge impact on the environment
-Some people have a hard time controlling themselves in overspending on food as well and keep on purchasing unnecessary stuff and not on the things they need
-Some people cannot afford food easily as Singapore is an expensive place. 
-Even with all these measures, some people still overestimate what they can consume overall. Businesses currently do not have an easy way to donate left over food which is why they throw it away and may not be incentivised enough fo give it for free(?) 
-Food wastage overall contributes to climate change. A phenomenon that causes extreme weather patterns which could potentially kill hundreds of millions of people. 
-Grocery stores typically overstock their food. They lose 15 billion a year because of that (Why do they do this even though large businesses keep track of inventory(?), its because it makes them more profit due to human psychology that they likely will buy more if stocks are full) 








The solution to the problems
The main idea is a food management system that keeps track of what you have in the fridge (And you can have one family household account), the expiry times as well as an inbuilt shopping list that prevents overspending. The website can also show the impact that you have made on climate change to have a sense of progress and encouragement. In order to further mitigate wasted food, people can give away items that they don’t really need or that are close to expiry but they can’t consume by another person for collection. 





Why this solves the problem
This solves the problem as this food management system reduces the amount of food wastage in the system. It also ensures that it gives an opportunity for food to be used no matter what. Businesses can easily keep track and waste less food due to these solutions and families can prevent wasting money.
